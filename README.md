# BUSI_Segmentation_SegFormer
Usage of SegFormer architecture for breast cancer segmentation of Ultrasound images. Using the publicly available Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI) database,  

To establish segmentation feasibility, initial experiments were conducted using the publicly available Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI) dataset. It contains 780 images from 600 female patients, categorized into normal, benign, and malignant cases, each with a corresponding ground truth mask outlining the lesion area [51]. All images were manually annotated by expert radiologists and underwent pre-processing. This dataset has been widely used within the scientific community in recent years [41]. Nevertheless, previous authors have detected some anomalies in the annotations [17]. After carefully exploring the dataset, we realized that many cases seem to be repeated and slightly misannotated. To further investigate the nature of BUSI and avoid bias in the model evaluation, a duplicate image recognition and mask evaluation were performed.
